## data
General location for example data.  This contains shell scripts to download various data,
just use in terminal "bash pull\_*script*\_.sh" for Linux (may be different for Mac OS).

These inlude:

- *SPT-SZ* combined maps (95, 150, and 220 GHz)
- *SPT-SZ* combined alms (spherical harmonic coefficients).  They take more time to download,
 but at least for me were less memory-intensive to view (IDK exactly why, something with healpy).
- *SPT-SZ* other products, such as masks.
- *SPT Cluster Catalog* For example stacking of clusters.
- *ACT DR5* maps.  In their Plate-Carree CAR projection.  Hence requires pixell to run.
- *ACT DR5* fullivar (inverse variance maps).
- *ACT DR5* Auxilliary products, i.e. frequency/band responses.
- *Planck* CMB no-SZ map for map processing notebook.

Also of note: for latest *Planck* maps, see https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/Planck/release_3/all-sky-maps/
