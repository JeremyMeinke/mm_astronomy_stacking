## hpc_stacking_example
This contains relevant code for stacking catalogs of ra/dec on HPC (high performance computing)
such as *agave* at ASU.  This is useful when requiring high-resolution cutouts or large catalogs.

To run on an HPC network such as *agave*: copy stacking.py along with this relevant code
in hpc\_stacking\_example to an HPC account.  Run via the shell script, i.e. "sbatch run\_hpc\_stack\_example.sh"
