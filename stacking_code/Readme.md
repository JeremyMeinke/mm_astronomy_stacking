## stacking_code
This contains relevant code for stacking catalogs of ra/dec, either for images 
or apertures. Such as circular CAP (see Schaan et al., 2021) or radial average apertures.

To run on an HPC network such as *agave*: copy stacking.py along with the relevant code
in hpc\_stacking\_example to an HPC account.  Run via the shell script, i.e. "sbatch run\_hpc\_stack\_example.sh"
