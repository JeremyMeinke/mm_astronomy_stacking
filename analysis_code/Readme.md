### Analysis_code

This contains a range of python functions I have found useful in analyzing stacked mm astronomy data.  This ranges from:

- General plotting and functions (general.py)
- Specfic functions to fit my data to, such as tSZ+dust fit, radial profile fits, etc (astro_analysis.py)
- My custom set of functions for fitting other functions.  These allow for GLS and Bayesian analysis (func_fitting.py)

See analysis_example.ipynb notebook for details on many of the functions.  Most are also now well-documented within the code itself too.
